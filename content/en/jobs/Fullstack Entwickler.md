The widespread use of apps on smartphones not only brings many advantages, but also significant security risks: For example, research shows that many widely used apps contain obfuscated strings that indicate intrusions into the user's privacy and security. To assess risks and analyze apps, we are developing a platform as part of the startup project Queryella that combines different app scanners, e.g. for risk assessment of deployed crypto routines or deobfuscation of hidden data and functions, and makes them accessible to different target groups. 

Queryella is a startup project out of the TU Darmstadt, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the StartupSecure program line. Our team consists of leading scientists with many years of experience and comprehensive expertise in the field of static analysis and IT security as well as people with many years of management and sales experience.

To complement our team, we are looking for a Full-Stack Developer for a code analysis platform as of 01.04.2023, initially limited until 31.03.2024 (full/part time).



## What we expect

- You will develop a concept for a scalable and flexible architecture that can be easily extended by different backends and implement this system with current technologies to examine millions of apps and store the results.
- You actively communicate with the other project members regarding planning, organization and documentation of the platform and a suitable web connection.
- You are responsible for the complete IT product lifecycle in a self-dependent and self-organized way. In your role as a full-stack developer, you will select the right solution path that will enable us to move potential customers forward quickly.
- You also contribute to the technological development of the platform and the different backends.

## Your profile

- Your focus lies in the areas of backend or fullstack. In addition, it would be an advantage if you are familiar with current programming languages and technologies, such as - - Golang, TypeScript, Docker, Linux, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, micro-services or serverless computing, distributed, scalable architectures and continuous integration.
- Ideally, you have already gained initial experience in large projects as a developer and system architect.
- You have a degree in (business) computer science, mathematics, physics or comparable courses of study as well as very good German and English skills.
- You are enthusiastic about data protection and IT security and would like to advance these topics together with us.

## What we offer

- Collaboration in an exciting and high-potential startup project.
- Interesting tasks with design and development opportunities in a high-potential startup project.
- Good induction and regular feedback as well as an open and friendly working atmosphere
