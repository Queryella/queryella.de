Nowadays, a large part of our lives takes place in the digital world, whether professionally or privately. We use our smartphones and a variety of apps, which creates more and more data every day. The Queryella team aims to protect our data from misuse by analyzing software for possible security or privacy issues that would allow third parties to intercept our data and use it for unauthorized purposes. 
<br><br>
For this reason, we at Queryella are working on a platform that enables in-depth code analysis of mobile apps for security vulnerabilities and privacy breaches, helping to protect users and businesses.
