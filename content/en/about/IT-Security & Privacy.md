We have been successfully using our code analysis skills for several years in various research projects, e.g., [ACCEPT](https://software-cluster.com/projects/accept/) or [ATHENE](https://www.athene-center.de/) (formerly known as CRISP) to develop technologies and tools that detect and expose security or privacy issues in software. The objective is to improve security for the operators and users of software.
